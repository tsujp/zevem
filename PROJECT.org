* Zevem

** Project Focus
Current area of focus so I don't forget what I was doing.

2025/09/11 TODO: Could use org-agenda to collect the requisite headlines instead of enforcing a literal structure (by having them all under here). Yak shave that later.

*** TODO Message Call

TODO: Finish refreshing myself on what I need to catch up on here.

**** JUMP
:LOGBOOK:
CLOCK: [2025-10-21 Tue 17:18]--[2025-10-21 Tue 19:04] =>  1:46
- JUMP/JUMPDEST implemented with basic tests. DynamicBitSetUnmanaged to pre-scan and construct bitset of valid JUMPDEST locations.
CLOCK: [2025-09-24 Wed 22:14]--[2025-09-24 Wed 22:58] =>  0:44
- More reading on JUMP and friends, yep we gotta do all the validation ourselves. Oh boy.
CLOCK: [2025-09-24 Wed 18:46]--[2025-09-24 Wed 19:08] =>  0:22
- Read associated YP information, need to implement JUMPDEST too and some more logic according to 9.4.3 so will do this later.
:END:

(9.4.3) Function D determines set of valid jump destinations. To be valid:

1. Position must be occupied by a JUMPDEST instruction.
2. JUMPDEST must not reside within data portion of any PUSH.
3. Must appear within explicitly defined bytecode, and not the implicit infinite STOP padding.

Zig bit sets look good for this: https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.14.1/std/#std.bit_set

Not possible to know bytecode length at comptime, could set an upperbound but would require re-compiling if block gas limits change to allow more bytecode to be executed so DynamicBitSetUnmanaged from stdlib looks like a good pre-provided data structure for this.

***** TODO Is it our job (as zevem) to assert 2 and 3? That would require ahead of time scanning the entire bytecode to execute or checking left-right of JUMPDEST to see if it resides within any PUSH (at every such call)
:LOGBOOK:
- State "TODO"       from              [2025-09-24 Wed 22:24] \\
  If we need to do these checks it can get complicated
:END:

YES IT'S OUR JOB

Q: Do we have to analyse ahead of time or can we do it as we go and revert then and there? Potential issues perhaps? Do the ahead of time first since it's simpler for now. I think we will have to since there's no guarantee all of the bytecode will be explored so trying to determine during runtime (and not ahead of time) if a JUMPDEST is actually a JUMPDEST and not a byte in the data portion of a PUSH will be quite hard and cost more computationally than looking at all of the bytecode and creating a bitmask. Benchmark later, this seems like a hyper-optimisation.

What if it wants to set a program counter above u64?

Look at (160) 9.4.3 which defines how JUMP and JUMPDEST are required to interact. Continue from there.

**** JUMPI
:LOGBOOK:
CLOCK: [2025-10-21 Tue 19:32]--[2025-10-21 Tue 20:02] =>  0:30

:END:
Yellow-paper says _prior_ but (small) experimentation suggests _current_? Going with current for now, need to check this later.

**** TODO CALLDATASIZE
:LOGBOOK:
- State "TODO"       from              [2025-11-27 Thu 21:07] \\
  CALLDATASIZE pushes I_d, currently using that (incorrectly). The opcode now exists in zevem but Transaction.zig needs to be adjusted
CLOCK: [2025-11-27 Thu 20:46]--[2025-11-27 Thu 21:06] =>  0:20
- CALLDATASIZE but Transaction needs to be adjusted
:END:

**** TODO GASPRICE
:LOGBOOK:
- State "TODO"       from              [2025-12-18 Thu 22:20] \\
  GASPRICE as it's been added (stubbed basically) is not really being used, tx.gas_price is ignored. Can probably clean up or optimise the gas situation a little? Clarity will come when library is used and API is more concrete.

** Yellowpaper Notes

*** Conventions

- Double-stroked N :: scalars are non-negative integers.
- Double-stroked B :: set of all byte sequences.

If N is subscripted (e.g. N_256) it is the set of all non-negative integers smaller than 2^256.
If B is subscripted (e.g. B_32) it is the set of all byte sequences of length 32.

Square brackets index into, and/or reference individual components or subsequences.

Two adjacent dots (yellowpaper mistakenly calls ellipsis) denote inclusive range.

Modified and utilisable value of a thing is denoted prime ′ and intermediate values superscript one or two asterisks.

Empty sequence denoted () and empty set ∅ and these are not equal to each other.

*** Structure

**** World State
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: σ -- bold-face sigma
:END:

Maps addresses (160-bit identifiers) and account states (RLP serialised data). Not stored on-chain, usually maintained in a modified Merkle Patricia tree (herein: trie) held by some database ("state database").
*************** TODO Any of the formulas on page 4 which are relevant for just-the-EVM implementation.
*************** END

***** Account State
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: σ[a] -- bold-face sigma, indexed by a
:END:

Accounts have four fields. Accounts are empty if they have no code, zero nonce, and zero balance (f.14).

****** Nonce
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: σ[a]_n -- bold-face sigma, indexed by a, subscripted by n
:END:

Scalar number of transactions sent from address. If account has associated code, number of contract-creations made by account.

****** Balance
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: σ[a]_b -- bold-face sigma, indexed by a, subscripted by b
:END:

Scalar amount of Wei owned by address.

****** Storage-root
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: σ[a]_s -- bold-face sigma, indexed by a, subscripted by s
:END:

256-bit hash for root node of trie that encodes the storage contents for account. Stylised: *storageRoot*.
*************** TODO More detailed storageRoot notes
Yellowpaper pg 4 left-side.
*************** END

****** Code-hash
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: σ[a]_c -- bold-face sigma, indexed by a, subscripted by c
:END:

Hash of EVM code associated with account. Such code will be executed when a message call is received. Code is stored keyed by their Keccak-256 hash. Subscript c refers to the code-hash, stylised: *codeHash*.

Bold b refers to the concrete code. Thus KEC(b) = σ[a]_c.

If codeHash is hash of empty string (i.e. σ[a]_c = KEC(())) then the node is a simple account, aka "non-contract" account.
*************** TODO What is "node" here??
bottom of page 4 in yp
*************** END

**** Machine State
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: μ -- bold-face mu
:END:

*************** TODO Machine state notes
*************** END

μ_i: bottom of page 29 is the maximum number of words of active memory, and pg15 9.4.1
m: memory contents, a series of zeroes of size 2^256.
i: active number of words in memory, counting continuously from zero.

**** Transaction
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T -- italic capital t
:END:

Single cryptographically-signed instruction. Sender cannot be a contract. EIP-2718 introduces different transaction types (via a transaction envelope).

- 0 :: legacy
- 1 :: EIP-2930
- 2 :: EIP-1559

Transactions can create new accounts with associated code (informally "contract creation"), or result in message calls.

***** Common Transaction Fields

All transactions have common fields:

****** type
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T_x -- italic capital t, subscript x
:END:

EIP-2718 transaction type.

****** nonce
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T_n -- italic capital t, subscript n
:END:

Scalar number of transactions sent by sender.

****** gasLimit
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T_g -- italic capital t, subscript g
:END:

Scalar maximum amount of gas which /could/ be used in executing this transaction. Paid up-front before any computation. Immutable during transaction.

****** to
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T_t -- italic capital t, subscript t
:END:

160-bit address of the message call's recipient. If contract creation then ∅ which here represents B_0 (set of all byte sequences of length zero).

****** value
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T_v -- italic capital t, subscript v
:END:

Scalar amount of Wei to transfer to message call's recipient. If contract creation then an endowment to newly created account.

****** r
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T_r -- italic capital t, subscript r
:END:

Signature of transaction.
*************** TODO And for s, see Appendix F of yp for these definitions
see also bottom left of page 5 of yp
*************** END

****** s
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T_s -- italic capital t, subscript s
:END:

Sender of transaction.

***** Legacy Transaction Fields

****** w
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T_w -- italic capital t, subscript w
:END:

Scalar encoding of Y parity, and possibly chain ID. This is essentially the chainId and yParity fields but for legacy transactions. See EIP-155.

***** EIP-2930, EIP-1559 Transaction Fields

****** accessList
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T_A -- italic capital t, subscript bold-face capital a
:END:

List of access entries to warm up.
*************** TODO What does that mean? Plus notes on the tuple information there.
*************** END

****** chainId
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T_c -- italic capital t, subscript c
:END:

Chain ID, must be equal to network chain ID denoted β.

****** yParity
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T_y -- italic capital t, subscript y
:END:

Signature Y parity.
*************** TODO What?
yp pg5 left side.
*************** END

***** Gas Pricing

Type 2 transactions specify gas pricing differently to type 0 and type 1.

****** Legacy, EIP-2930 Gas Pricing

Single field.

******* gasPrice
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T_p -- italic capital t, subscript p
:END:

Scalar maximum amount of Wei payable per unit of gas for all computation costs relating to execution of this transaction.

****** EIP-1559 Gas Pricing

Two fields related to gas intended to explicitly limit priority fee magnitude.

******* maxFeePerGas
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T_m -- italic capital t, subscript m
:END:

Scalar maximum amount of Wei payable per unit of gas for all computation costs relating to execution of this transaction.

******* maxPriorityFeePerGas
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T_f -- italic capital t, subscript f
:END:

Scalar maximum amount of Wei payable to block's fee recipient as an incentive to include the transaction.

***** Contract Creation Fields

Regardless of transaction type, a contract creation transaction has the field:

****** init
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T_i -- italic capital t, subscript i
:END:

Unlimited size byte array of EVM bytecode for account initialisation procedure. Specifically, init is a code-fragment which returns a /body/ (a second fragment of code); the /body/ is executed each time the account receives a message call (whether from a transaction, or internal execution).

So, init is only executed once (at contract creation) and is discarded immediately thereafter.

***** Message Call Fields

For all transaction types which are message calls, there will be the field:

****** data
:PROPERTIES:
:YPNotation: T_d -- italic capital t, subscript d
:END:

Unlimited size byte array specifying input data of the message call.

**** Gas and Payment

Fee schedule (Appendix G). The gasLimit T_g of a transaction is implicitly purchased from the sender's account balance at the effective gas price before any computation is performed. At the end of the transaction any unused gas is refunded (at the same rate of purchase) to the sender's account.

If this implicit purchase can not be made (not enough account balance) then the transaction is invalid.
*************** TODO effective gas price section 6
*************** END
*************** TODO gas does not exist outside of the execution of a transaction
i get that but what does the following (bottom-right pg8) then mean: Thus for accounts with trusted
code associated, a relatively high gas limit may be set and
left alone.
*************** END

Since EIP-1559 every transaction must pay a /base fee/ which is specified in Wei per unit of gas consumed and is immutable during each transaction in a given block. The Wei paid to meet the base fee is burned.

The base fee adjusts dynamically based on the previous block's gas consumption relative to it's /gas target/. The gas target is adjustable by validators.

If the previous block's total gas consumption exceeds it's gas target (i.e. high demand) the base fee is increased, and vice versa.
*************** TODO section 4.4 outlines how the base fee is set in detail
*************** END

To incentivise validators to include transactions a /priority fee/, also specified in Wei per unit of gas consumed, is payable. The total fee for a transaction is the sum of the base fee and priority fee then multiplied by the total gas consumed. The priority fee is paid to a /beneficiary/ address.

EIP-1559 transaction fields *maxPriorityFeePerGas* (maximum priority fee willing to pay), and *maxFeePerGas* (max total fee willing to pay, inclusive of priority and base fee). *maxFeePerGas* must be at least as high as the base fee to be included in a block. *maxPriorityFeePerGas* must not exceed *maxFeePerGas*.

Legacy, and EIP-2930 transaction field *gasPrice* (which also must be at least as high as the base fee for block inclusion) supplements base and priority fees (with less control). The extent to which *gasPrice* exceeds the base fee represents the implicit priority fee.

Opcodes can have associated constant and/or dynamic gas prices and (with rare exceptions) are checked /prior/ to opcode execution.

*************** TODO such exceptions are?
*************** END

Appendix G defines tuples of constant gas fees and associated operations. Appendix H.1 concretely defines the gas cost function which covers all EVM instructions however further investigation per-opcode via Appendix H.2 (the EVM instruction set) is required to finally determine all associated gas fees for an opcode.

Section 9.2 outlines three circumstances where gas is payable:

1. Intrinsic cost (usually constant, Appendices G, H.1).
2. Subordinate message calls or contract creation (CREATE, CREATE2, CALL, CALLCODE).
3. Increase in usage of memory.

(pg14 9.2) Opcodes which alter memory size pay gas according to the magnitude of memory modified in proportion to the smallest multiple of 32-bytes (i.e. WORD) required such that all indices (whether read or write) are included in said range. Essentially, any access to an area of memory 32-bytes greater than any previously indexed memory will incur a gas cost.

ROUGH:
pg30 330: memory-expansion function M used to determine the new u_i size, some opcodes (e.g. MSTORE) have a specific function defined at their definition within H.2 for what u_i should be instead. Not all opcodes use M, or have their own inline u_i definition.
pg29 328: memory-cost function C_mem simply computes the gas cost given memory size
SOURCE?: Memory is byte-aligned (2^8) and not u256 aligned.

** Datastructures

*** Opcodes, Gas cost, Stack deltas

An enum of opcodes tagged with a u8 provides constant time lookup, but how to associate gas cost and stack deltas without going crazy on the size of the datastructure.

Is a multiarraylist but keyed by an enum an option?

* Zig

** Datastructures

*** Enums

**** EnumMap

A map keyed by an enum, backed by a bitfield and a dense array. If the enum is exhaustive but not dense, a mapping will be constructed from enum values to dense indices. This type does no dynamic allocation and can be copied by value.

**** EnumArray

An array keyed by an enum, backed by a dense array. If the enum is not dense, a mapping will be constructed from enum values to dense indices. This type does no dynamic allocation and can be copied by value.

**** EnumMultiset

A multiset of enum elements up to a count of usize. Backed by an EnumArray. This type does no dynamic allocation and can be copied by value.

**** EnumSet

A set of enum elements, backed by a bitfield. If the enum is exhaustive but not dense, a mapping will be constructed from enum values to dense indices. This type does no dynamic allocation and can be copied by value.

**** BoundedEnumMultiset

A multiset of enum elements up to CountSize. Backed by an EnumArray. This type does no dynamic allocation and can be copied by value.

* Tracing

** Zone Naming and Statistics

Calling Tracy as follows:

#+begin_src zig
fn someFunction() {
    const zone = tracy.initZone(@src(), .{ .name = "foobar" });
}
#+end_src

Will compute statistics for a zone named ~foobar~ as expected. If calling Tracy like this however:

#+begin_src zig
fn someFunction() {
    const zone = tracy.initZone(@src(), .{});
    zone.name("foobar");
}
#+end_src

Then the zone will be doubly-named as ~someFunction~ (from its enclosing scope) and ~foobar~ however statistics will only be computed under the ~someFunction~ name. This isn't important in this simple example but imagine now a parameter is given to set the zone name:

#+begin_src zig
fn someFunction(name: []const u8) {
    const zone = tracy.initZone(@src(), .{});
    zone.name(name);
}
#+end_src

This will result in zones named as expected but no statistics will be computed for each ~name~, they will all be under (statistically) the ~someFunction~ moniker. This can be beneficial in some scenarios, if statistics per ~name~ are desired Tracy must be called as:

#+begin_src zig
fn someFunction(name: []const u8) {

* TODO Zig 0.14.0 Update & Notes

It currently does run correctly, but things like GPA being renamed and ArrayLists being unmanaged by default now and the like need to be accounted for.

** TODO Language

*** Labelled Switch
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#Labeled-Switch

Already in-use, some central notes though:
- ~switch~ statement can be labeled, ~continue~ within such statements takes single operand which is treated as replacement for enclosing switch expressions operand thus explicitly stating the next prong to execute.
- Can ~break~ from labeled switch which terminates its evaluation causing it to result in the given value to ~break~. The ~break~ must be given the switch's label to target it similarly to breaking out of blocks.
- Labeled switches are *not* implicitly evaluated at comptime but such can be forced with the ~comptime~ keyword.
- Semantically equivalent to switch inside a loop where a variable tracks switch operand and said variable is modified in each prong to control the subsequent prong to be executed.

Labeled switch designed to improve code-generation for hot loops such as those which dispatch instructions.

If operand to ~continue~ is comptime-known it is translated to an unconditional branch; this is a "perfectly predicted" branch and is very fast.

If operand to ~continue~ is runtime-known each continue can become a seperate conditional branch (ideally via shared jump table) back to the same set of conditional branch targets. This aids the CPU branch predictor by associating different branch instructions and their prediction data.

Zig's tokeniser is 13% faster with labeled switches: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/21367

**** TODO How to check and force that the jump table is shared for labeled switch runtime-known conditional branches?

Is the only implication of it NOT being shared that the binary size is larger due to duplicated jump tables? It should still be just as fast since it's the same jump table data-wise no?

*** TODO Decl Literals
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#Decl-Literals

READ NEXT AFTER TODOs CREATED.

*** TODO @export Operand Pointer

*** @FieldType Builtin
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#FieldType-builtin

Similar to ~std.meta.FieldType~, give a type and the name of one of it's fields and get back the type of that field.

*** TODO @memcpy Rules Adjusted
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#memcpy-Rules-Adjusted

** TODO Standard Library

*** GeneralPurposeAllocator is now DebugAllocator
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#DebugAllocator

=GeneralPurposeAllocator= used to rely on compile-time known page size (now removed as nonsensical). Now rewritten to make fewer active mappings and have better performance it is also renamed =DebugAllocator=.

Note: initialise with ~.init~ declaration literal and not ~.{}~ now.

*** TODO SmpAllocator
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#SmpAllocator

*** TODO Allocator API

*** TODO Zon Parsing

*** TODO Runtime Page Size
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#Runtime-Page-Size

*** TODO process.Child.collectOutput API
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#processChildcollectOutput-API-Changed

*** LLVM Builder API
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#LLVM-Builder-API

Zig's LLVM bitcode builder is now available at =std.zig.llvm=. Note that everything in the =std.zig= namespace is an implementation detail of the Zig compiler and isn't subject to the same API stability and deprecation norms as the rest of =std=.

*** Unmanaged Containers
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#Embracing-Unmanaged-Style-Containers

- Managed container types (which internally associate an allocator for their lifetime) are deprecated and will be removed in the next Zig version (0.15.0).
- Unmanaged container types are now the norm and require passing (the same) allocator at every callsite where such a method requires it.
- Zig stdlib =ArrayHashMapWithAllocator= happens to have an implementation of a "traditional" managed-style approach which (I think) is intended for the future. Unsure if that will also be discouraged / deprecated in 0.15.0 (as in, within stdlib itself). As users we're free to create our own managed-style approaches.

*** Better Binary Search API
https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/20927

For: =std.sort.binarySort=, =std.sort.lowerBound=, =std.sort.upperBound=, and =std.sort.equalRange=.

*** std.hash_map Rehash Method
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#stdhash_map-gains-a-rehash-method

Currently unordered hash maps become slow when items are removed from them, in future Zig versions this will be fixed.

Array hash maps are free of this flaw.

** TODO Build System
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#Build-System
https://ziglang.org/learn/build-system/

READ THIS ONE WHEN DONE MAKING TODOs:
- File System Watching
- New Package Hash Format
- WriteFile Step
- RemoveDir Step
- Fmt Step

*** Creating Artifacts from Existing Modules
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#Creating-Artifacts-from-Existing-Modules

=Compile= steps can be created from existing =std.Build.Module= objects. Easier to re-use now, e.g. a module which is a dependency of another can more easily have a test step created for it.

New APIs change usage of =addExecutable=, =addTest= etc. No longer pass =root_source_file=, =target=, =optimize= (etc) directly but a =*std.Build.Module= to the =root_module= field with said module taking aforementioned options instead.

*** TODO Allow Packages to Expose Arbitrary LazyPaths by Name

*** addLibrary Function
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#addLibrary-Function

=addLibrary= replaces =addSharedLibrary= and =addStaticLibrary=.

** TODO Compiler
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#Compiler

- Comptime import ZON.
- tokenizer: simplification and spec conformance

** TODO Linker
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#Linker

** TODO Fuzzer
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#Fuzzer

** TODO UBSan Runtime
https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#UBSan-Runtime

Maybe (if things like tracy or valgrind for whatever reason aren't good enough, which I doubt) how UBSan modifies things at compile time could be an approach for instrumentation etc etc. Again, doubt it since tracy/valgrind.

* Misc TODOs

** TODO ArrayHashMapWithAllocator inspiration potential custom wrapper type
:LOGBOOK:
- State "TODO"       from              [2025-09-05 Fri 03:28] \\
  Prior comment on EVM.mem
:END:

Zig 0.14.0 deprecates managed container types. Unmanaged container types must pass the same allocator at the callsite for methods which require it and do so every time. Perhaps create a wrapper (or appropriate custom type) later on to ease this (potential) burden. Zig std ArrayHashMapWithAllocator is an example of such.

** TODO Look at using the Writer API style for things like output
:LOGBOOK:
- State "TODO"       from              [2025-08-12 Tue 19:11]

Can have a reader/writer and write into it (doesn't have to be stdout) but any data structure I think. This could be a nice pattern to investigate using later.

** TODO Would keccak_p.zig benefit from the labelled switch api changes?
See: https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#src/std/crypto/keccak_p.zig

The State function loops over some enums, that to function could use a labelled switch instead?

** TODO Any of that snapshot testing for everyone from tigerbeetle appropriate for our opcode unit tests later on?

See: https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2024-05-14-snapshot-testing-for-the-masses/

** TODO Add custom EvmError errors and use those instead

Perhaps as a tagged enum? I forgot the proper term for this, have to double check notes. Either way want to replace the implicit error return of EVM.execute() from !void to somethin explicit.

** TODO Maybe a less verbose and/or more detailed tracing guide in zevem README

It's fine for now probably.

** TODO Perhaps bench the old decodeOp before the change to log opcode via tracy

Yeah some overhead is added but how much idk, use poop or something to retroactively do this. Circa 2025-04-01 is when change to decodeOp occured (with tracy addition and so on).

** TODO Add a just recipe for andrewrk's basic zig benchmark tool

It's called poop or something, get a recipe for that and execute it to start basic benchmarking shit.

** TODO Have a look at Zig's source code for labelled switch usage

As part of adding tracy have a look at any non-trivial ways Zig's own source is using labelled switches, mostly I'm curious about putting things like stack variable checks in what is currently decodeOp which is run as part of (almost) every continue statement. In that sense it functions similarly to the top of a while loop which is followed by a switch statement, except our usage of a labelled switch here keeps cpu branch predictability performance gains.

** TODO Finish Jam script

It's fine for now, mostly a skeleton and should probably symlink to a central one for sharing and/or make it a little CLI tool for easier consumption. We'll see.

** TODO Custom error added on POP instruction, but do we want such errors?

Do we expect that any bytecode given to us is free from such errors and simply crash hard if encountered or do we surface those to the host? The compiled code is already going to check since Zig by default provides that ~orelse unreachable~ if we don't specify anything. This could be a compile option (our custom errors) if there is in-fact any overhead and if in-fact we want to continue down that path.

Another thing to note is that.. what makes POP so special? What about DUP now.. what about every single other opcode? I think /for now/ I may remove the POP custom error logic because it feels like the compiler that is feeding us bytecode, or the adept user who is handwriting such, should be responsible for that.

Things like trying to expand memory and that being an error we do surface (RETURN/REVERT) because that's our job as the VM -- thus, a difference in semantics I suppose.

** TODO Comptime test generation for opcodes?

E.g. generate tests for all of the N-style opcodes PUSH-N, DUP-N etc. Doesn't really feel worth it versus literally writing them.

** TODO Test cases described in Zon?

Maybe something like:

#+begin_src zig
.{
    // .bc for bytecode, .s for stack .s.l stack length, .s.i stack items from top etc.
    .bc = "5f600a8100",
    .s = .{
        .l = 0,
        .i = .{ 0, 0xa }
    }
}
#+end_src

** TODO Containerfile appropriate for Linux hosts too

All the uid mapping shit probably not required on Linux hosts since it's not going macOS <==> Linux-VM <==> container with the macOS uid/gid being the ones we want to maintain.

** TODO Maybe change to using Just for project commands

Problem is when you want to do a lot of shell-stuff Just executes each line of the recipe in it's own shell so if you have variables, or need the output of a prior command you need to have a recipe that is basically a heredoc shell script by adding #!/usr/bin/env bash to it.. at that point I'd rather just use a shell script directly.

** TODO Fuzzing with AFL++

Haven't looked into fuzzing approaches yet; just found this while browsing other Zig things and it could be beneficial later: https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus and for Zig: https://github.com/kristoff-it/zig-afl-kit?tab=readme-ov-file

** TODO Ziggy on-disk test cases for bytecode and what not
:LOGBOOK:
- State "TODO"       from              [2025-08-15 Fri 16:50]
:END:

Instead of evmBasicBytecode or most manual literal tests in source, perhaps replace them with test files on-disk which are read to execute EVM instructions and then the unit test in Zig code is about asserting expected values.

This feels like more of an experiment since the value in doing so is perhaps dubious versus in-source tests. Have to investigate. Not very important.

** TODO Columnar disassembly output hacking
:LOGBOOK:
- State "TODO"       from              [2025-08-30 Sat 17:45]
:END:

Could do this to get nice auto-column aligned output wihtout having to write too much custom stuff.

#+begin_src sh

- Tramp using which instead of looping to find commands (as container now has it?)

- Tramp gpg-agent
- Tramp git config

- Tramp per container history file (i.e. don't clobber general, global history file)
- Additionally, tramp history in its own history file to better distinguish user commands vs tramps?
- Tramp homedir for jam stuff, have it use a default username etc.

so with tramp_bundle_read_file_names is vc.el asking it to check those paths? Cos it looks like the tramp command is GIVEN the paths /home/jammy/project/build.zig and /home/jammy/project/.git and /home/jammy and /home/jammy/.git and /.git but what is giving it those paths in the first place?

purpose of LOGNAME env var?

git --no-pager ls-files -c -z -- build.zig


Emacs environment replacement, what is $d used for after a remote connection has been established?


Better function for tramp_bundle_read_file_names called by tramp-maybe-send-script

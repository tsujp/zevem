#+TITLE: zevem

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implemented in Zig -- /just/ the EVM.

zevem is primarily designed to be embedded into a host Ethereum client but also *plans to* incorporate various developer-focused features like:

1. Bytecode debugger (with worldstate via EVMC).
2. Bytecode (dis)assembler.
3. Solidity decompiler (NOTE: Extremely "maybe" since this will also require deep knowledge of how the Solidity compiler and it's various versions likes to compile things etc).

** Status

Pre-alpha work-in-progress. Currently only concerned about use within [[https://github.com/stateless-consensus/phant][Phant]] as the first host client (and therefore real-world proof of zevem's correct implementation etc). Contributions and ideation of course welcome (open an issue or contact via email for discussion beforehand please).

See [[./PROJECT.org][zevem's project planning file]] for TODOs, further resources etc.

** Build / Develop / Contribute

The only real dependency is Zig =0.14.0=, everything is developer tooling.

A [[./justfile][justfile]] (see: [[https://github.com/casey/just][Just]]) provides simpler access to common project commands. Execute ~just~ anywhere within this project repo to see a list of available commands, common ones are:

To build:

#+begin_src sh
just build
#+end_src

To run all tests:

#+begin_src sh
just test
#+end_src

The justfile is configured (by default) to echo the commands it executes; it's syntax is very readable however and is mostly a convenient alias for various Zig build-system commands.

*** Developer Environments / Tooling

The =.jam= /directory/ includes a =Containerfile= (aka. =Dockerfile=) for container-based workflows. It is primarily written for use with [[https://podman.io/][Podman]] but should also work with Docker. It is currently written for macOS hosts running containers; i.e. an implicit Linux-VM which itself is actually managing containers.

The =jam= /file/ (shell-script) at the repository root can be used to build/create/run development containers. These are not based on "Development Containers" from Micro$oft as that specification, amongst others, are JSON-plagued overly complicated hellscapes.

To build a container image with all zevem dependencies including extra utilities for general debugging:

#+begin_src sh
./jam make
#+end_src

To create and run the built container image, replacing any that may exist:

#+begin_src sh
./jam run
#+end_src

This repo's files are bind-mounted into the container at =/home/jammy/project= so no work is lost when deleting/re-building/re-creating (etc) the container so long as you stick within that bind-mounted directory.
